Closure Scope (jquery) vs block scope (javascript)

Self executing function 
(function(){
	var e = 1;
	console.log("we're here")
})

JQUery events can be listed using the .on('blur') or you can call the function by using .blur

DOM bubbling happens for JQeury events, the event is registered for all parent elements

can be cancelled with e.stopPropagation();
e.preventDefault(); prevents the action from changing default settings

.css()
put one argument in, you get a return for the value, put in 2 arguments you set that value with the 2nd argument


don't have to use '.this' to select the context
.call()
.apply()


Local Storage

localStorage.getItem
localStorage.setItem
localStorage.removeItem
localStorage.clear

accessible in other tabs
