Closures

returning a function from a function

var outer = function(){
	return function(){
	alert('hello');
  };
};

var outersInner = outer();

outersInner();

whatever the output of the function is becomes the far
can pass arguments to inner or outer as long as the syntax matches when you call it. 

var outer = function(){
	var x = 'hello world';
	return function(){
		alert(x);
	};
};


inner functions can see variables for outside functions as well as higher scopes

benefit is to allow you to have private variables(not accessible by other functions) more like a black box.
