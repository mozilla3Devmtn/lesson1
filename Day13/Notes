Notes: JQuery and the DOM
Library is commonly used commands pre-compiled and ready to go
Framework has common functions and includes "structure" for organization and code management.
Jquery uses common javascript commands but uses "shorthand-style" syntax
Important things
1) have fun, find ways to be creative
2) read documentation
3) become familiar with the DOM
4) when you write code, just make it work, you can simplify/improve it later
use a "CDN" content delivery network to reference plugins from 3rd parties like the Javascript files
